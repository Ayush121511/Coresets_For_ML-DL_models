# Coresets for Image Segementation
* Coresets are used to reduce the time taken to perform image segmentation for size reduction of the image.
* Base algorithm used is *k-Means Clustering*.
* Size of the image reduced from *460 KB* to *19 KB*.
* Time to execute original algorithm: 10 min.
* Time to execute algorithm using coresets: 2 min.
