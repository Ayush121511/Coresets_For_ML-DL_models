# Coresets_For_ML-DL_models
*	Implementing algorithm to create Coresets â€“ a sample reduction method to upscale the working of Deep Learning models.
*	Performed image segmentation by creating Coresets, which improved the model's efficiency ten times (base algorithm: k mean clustering algorithm).
*	Created sequential coresets, an algorithm implemented earlier for only logistic regression, now for neural networks.
