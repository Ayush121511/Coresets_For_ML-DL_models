# Coresets_For_ML-DL_models
*	Implementing algorithm to create Coresets â€“ a sample reduction method to upscale the working of Deep Learning models.
*	Optimized three different ML/DL algorithms using coresets.
  1.	k-Means clustering for a dataset of a high sample size.
  2.	Image segmentation by creating Coresets improved the model's efficiency ten times (base algorithm: k mean clustering algorithm).
  3.	Created sequential coresets, an algorithm implemented earlier for only logistic regression, now for neural networks.
